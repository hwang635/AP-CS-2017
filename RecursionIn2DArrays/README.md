# RecursionIn2DArrays

This project is two exercises using recursion with two-dimensional arrays, coded in Java. One exercise is an erasable black and white grid, the other solves a "maze" from an entered text file.

EraseObject\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Draws grid from inputted text file of two different characters\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One character type (asterisks) is translated to black squares\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A black square can be “erased” by clicking on it or any black square that directly borders it

Maze \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finds path through a “maze” in an inputted textfile of characters \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One character type represents the maze, one the free spaces, one the start and end points \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prints out the maze and marks the solution with exclamation marks

# GridGame - 2048 copy

This project is a copy of 2048 coded with Java. The game is a sliding tile game where a player slides and adds tiles in a grid. The goal is to combine tiles of the same number until a 2048 tile is created.

Features:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4x4 grid playing surface\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Score counter (score is the sum of all tile additions)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merge same-number tiles after they collide\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control of tiles through up, down, left, right arrow keys\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Win/loss detection - win when a 2048 tile is created, loss when the grid is full and no tiles can be combined
